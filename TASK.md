## Key Decisions & Notes

### 2026-01-05
- **Thumbnail Storage**: Storing TMDB CDN URLs (not binary images) for optimal performance
- **Rating System**: Using 5-star rating with upsert API (PUT /api/ratings/titles/:titleId)
- **External Links**: All TMDB links open in new tabs to preserve app state
- **Card Layout**: Horizontal flex layout with 64x96px poster thumbnails

### 2026-01-04
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js/Express, React/Vite, Neo4j, TMDB API, Anthropic Claude API
- **Authentication**: JWT with access (15m) and refresh tokens (7d)
- **State Management**: React Context API + Custom Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 for compatibility
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose with multi-stage builds
